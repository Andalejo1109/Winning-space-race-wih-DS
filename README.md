Coursera DS project
SpaceX Falcon-9 Success Landing Prediction
Predict if SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully after rocket launch.

Data collection with Webscraping and Data wrangling

## Objectives

Write Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame.
Convert a JSON file into a Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file
Create a Jupyter notebook and make it sharable using GitHub
Use data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.
Use your data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Make use a RESTful API and web scraping. Convert the data into a dataframe and then perform some data wrangling.

## Objectives

Create scatter plots and bar charts by writing Python code to analyze data in a Pandas data frame
Write Python code to conduct exploratory data analysis by manipulating data in a Pandas data frame
Write and execute SQL queries to select and sort data
Use your data visualization skills to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process.
Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards
Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash as well as build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium python Library.

## Objectives

Build an interactive dashboard that contains pie charts and scatter plots to analyze data with the Plotly Dash Python library
Calculate distances on an interactive map by writing Python code using the Folium library
Generate interactive maps, plot coordinates, and mark clusters by writing Python code using the Folium library
Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.
Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

## Predictive Analysis(Classification)

In this module, we'll use machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. Data will be split into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Then find the method that performs best using test data.
